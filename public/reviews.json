Your competitors in the area were happy to put me on bike's that would have been overkill at this time, for more than twice the cost of the Stache 8.  Sean was very helpfull in advising me on all the options I didn't need to spend money on at this time.   That is greatly appreciated.",

I called around to get information and he is the only one that took the time to look to see if the bike I wanted was available.  So I drive an hour to see him and he could not have been nicer.  And just so you know I bought the Trek 7.7 2013.",
